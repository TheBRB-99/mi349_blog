            Hello, My name is Brendan Brockway, I am in my last semester at MSU. My major is 
            Media and Information and my minor is business.
            <br/>
            I am making this blog as part of my lab assignmnet for MI349: Web Design and Development.
            I have a little expirience with coding but none with any markup languages like HTML.
            <br/>
            I am 23 years old and my hobbies include: Video games, Music, golfing and watching shows.
            I also enjoy going to bars and hanging out with friends on the weekends.
            <br/> 
            I hope you gained something from my posts, because even though they are just me talking about myself,
            I think there is something to gain from reading them. Have a nice day!
        </p>
